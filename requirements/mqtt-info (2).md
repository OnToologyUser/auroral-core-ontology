# Flood Sensor

## Event data

### Flood Sensor sends values on the following topics:

```
location-<location_id>/flood-<deviceid>/sensor/battery: battery level in %

location-<location_id>/flood-<deviceid>/sensor/flood: reports true when flood is detected, false otherwise

location-<location_id>/flood-<deviceid>/sensor/temperature: in 째C or 째F depending on configuration

location-<location_id>/flood-<deviceid>/sensor/error: if different from 0, there is an error with the sensor

location-<location_id>/flood-<deviceid>/sensor/act_reasons: list of reasons which woke up the device: battery, button, periodic, poweron, sensor, alarm
```

# Energy monitor

> ***Note***: `<i>` refers to phase and can accept values [0, 1, 2]

## Event data

### Energy monitor sends values on the following topics:
```
location-<location_id>/energy-<deviceid>/emeter/<i>/energy: energy counter in Watt-minute

location-<location_id>/energy-<deviceid>/emeter/<i>/returned_energy: energy returned to the grid in Watt-minute

location-<location_id>/energy-<deviceid>/emeter/<i>/total: total energy in Wh (accumulated in device's non-volatile memory)

location-<location_id>/energy-<deviceid>/emeter/<i>/total_returned: total energy returned to the grid in Wh (accumulated in device's non-volatile memory)

location-<location_id>/energy-<deviceid>/emeter/<i>/power: instantaneous active power in Watts

location-<location_id>/energy-<deviceid>/emeter/<i>/voltage: grid voltage in Volts

location-<location_id>/energy-<deviceid>/emeter/<i>/current: current in Amps

location-<location_id>/energy-<deviceid>/emeter/<i>/pf: power factor (dimensionless)

location-<location_id>/energy-<deviceid>/relay/0: reports status: on, off or overpower
```

## Write data

### Energy monitor accepts commands on the following topics:
```
location-<location_id>/energy-<deviceid>/relay/0/command: accepts on, off or toggle

location-<location_id>/energy-<deviceid>/emeter/<i>/command: accepts message reset_totals to reset total and total_returned energy counters to 0

location-<location_id>/energy-<deviceid>/command: accepts message reset_data to reset all device data
